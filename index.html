            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Lionel Messi is an <em>Argentinian soccer player</em> who has played for <strong>FC Barcelona, Paris
                    Saint-Germain,</strong> and <strong>
                    the Argentina national team</strong> . As a teenager, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC
                Barcelona
                agreed to pay for medical treatments related to his growth hormone disorder. At the club, he earned
                renown as one of the greatest players in history, helping FC Barcelona win more than two dozen league
                titles and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year and, a decade later,
                helped the Argentina national team win its third FIFA World Cup. The seven-time Ballon d Or winner moved
                to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021, and in July 2023, he joined MLS Inter Miami club.
